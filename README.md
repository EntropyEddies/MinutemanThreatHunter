## Overview

Minuteman Threat Hunter is a tool meant to assist in mapping your internal network and identifying potential threats. It is meant to be used by network administrators and security analysts to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in their network. It is not meant to be used as a replacement for a SIEM or other security tools, but rather as a supplement to them.
